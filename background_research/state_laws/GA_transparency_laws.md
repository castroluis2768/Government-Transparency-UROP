### Georgia Transparency Laws

**Georgia FOIA Laws**

- **Georgia Open Meetings Act** - declares that the public must have access to all open meetings held by a government entity on any level of Georgia government [1]
	-  Government entities must also give the public advance notice of any meeting [1]
	-  No closed meetings are permitted except under specific circumstances
	- **Meeting Transparency During Covid-19**:
		- Town Officials still are required to post info for accessing virtual meetings during the pandemic [1]
		- 24 hours of advance notice must be provided for virtual meetings
- **Georgia Open Records Act** - requires that town governments provide access to public records which can be requested or placed on websites [2]
	- Public records include the following:
		- Documents
		- Papers
		- Letters
		- Maps
		- Books
		- Tapes
		- Photographs
		- Computer-based or -generated information
	- Requests for public records do not require a reason for the request
- **Noncompliance Penalties**:
	- The Open Records Act allows any person, firm, corporation or other entity to bring a civil action to enforce compliance with the law. Moreover, the Attorney General may bring a civil or criminal action to enforce compliance with the law [2]
	- Additionally, public officials who participate in closed meetings in violation of the law can be subject to recall [2]
- **Digital Requirements in Georgia Sunshine Laws**
	- Open Meetings Act - agencies are required to post meeting information and schedules on its website if it has one [2]
	- Open Records Act - the law provides detailed guidelines related to requests for records maintained electronically. Specifically, agencies must provide electronic or printed copies of electronic records using the computer programs that the agency uses if they use one, and individuals are entitled to request production in the format in which the agency keeps the record or in a standard export format [2]
	- HB-397 was an update to the Georgia Sunshine Laws in 2012 which set out new guideliens for how towns would have to disclose information digitally
		- Updates language regarding electronic documents to ensure transparency is not compromised by technological advances [5]
		- The law clears up past court rulings and Sunshine Laws which muddled whether or not citizens should have access to records that are electronically stored [7]
	- Electronic Open Records Request:
		- Municipalities cannot refuse to produce electronic records just because production of the records will require inputting search, filter or report parameters into the city’s computer system [8]
		- Any person may make photographic copies or other electronic reproductions of public records requested using suitable portable devices [8]
	- City employees do not have to prepare reports, summaries or compilations of public records not in existence at the time of the request - but upon a public records request they cannot refuse to produce electronic records, data, or data fields on the grounds that exporting data or redaction of exempted information will require "inputting range, search, filter, report parameters, or similar commands or instructions into the city’s computer system" [8]
		- My note on this is that some city websites may not have certain pieces of information on their website since they haven't compiled that information - but would be required to compile that information upon request 
- **Budget Laws**
	- Every local government in Georgia is required by state law to adopt a balanced operating budget each year [10]
	- The following is required by law for towns when developing and publishing fiscal budgets:
		- Ensure the public can inspect the budget document and have opportunities to provide input during public hearings [10]
		- Ensure compliance with sound financial management practices and generally accepted accounting practices [10]
- **Additional Notes**:
	- I found a website with a list of city websites - in case if any of these cities aren't already on the list then they should be added - the link is [4] in the bibliography
	- Lots of Georgian local governments have been in violation of Sunshine laws and have had fines levied against them - a team of journalists named the SunLight Project openly attempts to promote open governments in these towns [3]
	- I found a report on a study on the budget transparency of Georgian Towns - perhaps we could discuss the methodology they use [9]
