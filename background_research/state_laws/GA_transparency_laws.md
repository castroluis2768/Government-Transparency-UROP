### Georgia Transparency Laws

**Georgia FOIA Laws**

- **Georgia Open Meetings Act** - declares that the public must have access to all open meetings held by a government entity on any level of Georgia government [1]
	-  Government entities must also give the public advance notice of any meeting [1]
	-  No closed meetings are permitted except under specific circumstances
	- **Meeting Transparency During Covid-19**:
		- Town Officials still are required to post info for accessing virtual meetings during the pandemic [1]
		- 24 hours of advance notice must be provided for virtual meetings
	- **Website Specific Requirement**:
		- Agencies are required to post meeting information and schedules on its website if it has one [2]
- **Georgia Open Records Act** - requires that town governments provide access to public records which can be requested or placed on websites [2]
	- Public records include the following:
		- Documents
		- Papers
		- Letters
		- Maps
		- Books
		- Tapes
		- Photographs
		- Computer-based or -generated information
	- Requests for public records do not require a reason for the request
	- **Website Specific Requirement**:
		- The law provides detailed guidelines related to requests for records maintained electronically. Specifically, agencies must provide electronic or printed copies of electronic records using the computer programs that the agency uses, and individuals are entitled to request production in the format in which the agency keeps the record or in a standard export format [2]

- **Noncompliance Penalties**:
	- The Open Records Act allows any person, firm, corporation or other entity to bring a civil action to enforce compliance with the law. Moreover, the Attorney General may bring a civil or criminal action to enforce compliance with the law [2]
	- Additionally, public officials who participate in closed meetings in violation of the law can be subject to recall [2]
- **Additional Notes**:
	- I found a website with a list of city websites - in case if any of these cities aren't already on the list then they should be added - the link is [4] in the bibliography
	- Lots of Georgian local governments have been in violation of Sunshine laws and have had fines levied against them - a team of journalists named the SunLight Project openly attempts to promote open governments in these towns [3]
