	- Personnel matters; impending litigation; security personnel, plans, and devices; misconduct investigations; extraordinary emergencies posing immediate or irrevocable harm to persons or property; the purchase, sale or leasing of lands; admissions tests; and the location, relocation or expansion of a business or industry [2]
- No notice need be given if the time and place of meeting is specifically prescribed by statute - however the minutes of a meeting must also publish the times and place the meeting was held (basically a requirement that minutes be published)
- **Requirements of Published Meeting Minutes:**
	- Must show "the members present and absent; the date, time and place of the meeting; an accurate recording of any final actions taken at such meeting; and a record, by individual member, of any votes taken; and any other information that the public body request be included or reflected in the minutes" [4]

**Recent Govt Transparency Legislation/Court Decisions**
- House Bill 1048 - would restrict the fees charged for open records to actual costs. The bill unanimously passed the House on February 10, 2009 [1]
- Senate Bill 2921 - would reduce the response time required by law for open records requests to seven days (rather than the then-current 14 days) and restrict fees charged for open records to actual costs. The Senate recommitted this bill to committee 26-23, which effectively killed it [1]
- Senate Bill 3109 - concerned the construction of artificial reefs in the Gulf and contained an exemption to FOIA. The House version of the bill did not contain the exemption [1]
**Additional Interesting Info**
