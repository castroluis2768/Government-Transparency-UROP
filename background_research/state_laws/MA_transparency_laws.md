### Massachusetts Transparency Laws Research
 
**Massachusetts Open Meetings Act**
- The Massachusetts Open Meetings Act legislates the methods by which public meetings are conducted [2]
- The law states that a meeting is any gathering of a quorum of members of a public body for the purposes of deliberating and deciding on public matters [2]
- The act requires all public bodies to post notice 48 hours in advance of any meeting [2]
- Governmental bodies keep minutes of all meetings including the time and date, the members in attendance, any discussions had and any votes taken
- Voting cannot be done in secret and must be recorded on the minutes
- Anyone has the right to record an open government meeting


**Massachusetts Public Records Act and FOIA Procedures**
- The Massachusetts Public Records Act is a series of laws designed to guarantee that the public has access to public records of government bodies at all levels in Massachusetts. It is located at Part I, Title X, Chapter 66 of the Massachusetts General Laws [3]
- Public records are defined as "all books, papers, maps, photographs, recorded tapes, financial statements, statistical tabulations, or other documentary materials or data, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by any officer or employee of any agency [3]
- The Massachusetts law does not contain any provisions that clearly bring private entities within the scope of the open records law
- The definition of public body presumably includes public universities within the state
	- However, testing and exam material are explicitly exempted
- No statement of purpose is required when requesting records [3]
- Massachusetts' law allows 10 days for record responses [3]

**Transparency Pertaining to Digital Materials and Websites**
- By law, "Guidelines shall be updated periodically and shall include a list of categories of public records maintained by the agency or municipality. Each agency and municipality that maintains a website shall post the guidelines on its website" [6]
- Each agency and municipality shall post in a conspicuous location at its offices and on its website, if any, the name, title, business address, business telephone number, and business email address of each records access officer [6]
	- Potentially we could add contact info for record access officers, onto the rubric, since this requirement is also specific to websites
- The records access officer shall provide the public records to a requestor by electronic means unless the record is not available in electronic form or the requestor does not have the ability to receive or access the records in a usable electronic form [6]
- Records must be maintained according to retention schedules based on the content of the records [6]
- Record storage must be maintained in a reliable, trustworthy format regardless the means of storgage (digital or hard copy) [6]
- If a custodian chooses to digitize a paper record, it must ensure it can maintain the digital file and provide appropriate access to it until the retention period is met [6]
- If the public record requested is available on an appropriately indexed and searchable public website, the RAO may furnish the public record by providing reasonable assistance in locating the requested record on the public website
- Section 32.05 (1)(f) is especially useful in terms of listing out requirements for what towns with websites have to post: the exact quote is "an agency shall provide on a searchable website electronic copies, accessible in a commonly available electronic format, of the following types of records, provided that any agency may withhold any record or portion thereof in accordance with state or federal law"
	- Final opinions, decisions, orders, or votes from agency proceedings
	- Annual reports
	- Notices of regulations proposed under M.G.L. c. 30A
	- Notices of hearings
	- Winning bids for public contracts
	- Awards of federal, state and municipal government grants
	- Minutes of open meetings
	- Agency budgets
- "Electronic Records Management Guidelines" set out guidelines assisting towns in maintaining digital records


**Interesting Studies**
- [1] detailed a study of transparency in a couple hundred MA municipality websites, there are also a detailed rubric of how the study detailed transparency scores which we could incorporate into our study
- The following are criteria in [1] study that are not in ours:
	- General bylaws, code, or an ordinance
	- Town Meeting Results - online posts of the results of votes in town meetings
	- Zoning by-laws
	- Community Calendar
	- Agenda/Minutes for School Committees
	- Agenda for at least one other town or city committee or board
