Model Accuracy
================

This document reports our estimates of the accuracy of the six models
that produce our transparency classifications. The estimates are
calculated using 3-fold cross calidation.

The three indicators are as follows:

  - *accuracy*: proportion of labels that are correctly classificed.
  - *negative predictive value*: proportion of towns labeled with a 0
    with a ground truth of 0.
  - *positive predictive value*: proportion of towns labeled with a 1
    with a ground truth of 1.
